### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jean-MaÃ«l Legrand, 22 years old, student in computer science and software engineering at UniversitÃ© de Technologie de Belfort-MontbÃ©liard (University of Technology of Belfort-MontbÃ©liard).

I like to:

- try new things even if it's a bit challenging. This allowed me to acquire knowledge in various fields (computer science, web development, game development, mathematics, animation, etc...), and put them into practice
- work efficiently and automate repetitive tasks (CI/CD, bash or python scripting, etc...)
- learn from others and appreciate interdisciplinarity
- discover other countries and cultures

#### What I'm working on **right now** ðŸŽ‰

I love [Dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), I used it in C, C++ and even in Unity and Python thanks to :

- [psydack/uimgui: UImGui (Unity ImGui) is an UPM package for the immediate mode GUI library using ImGui.NET. This project is based on RG.ImGui project.](https://github.com/psydack/uimgui)
- [hoffstadt/DearPyGui: Dear PyGui: A fast and powerful Graphical User Interface Toolkit for Python with minimal dependencies](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui)

Being interested in web development, Wasm and WebGL, I liked [flyover/imgui-js: JavaScript bindings for Dear ImGui using Emscripten and TypeScript](https://github.com/flyover/imgui-js) and found it very interesting!

Unfortunately, it currently seems unmainted so I am currently working on maintaining it.

Progress :

- [ ] Resolve current issues (In progress)
- [ ] Merge the merge requests
- [X] Update dependencies
- [ ] Enhance developer experience with clearer instructions and supporting hot reload (In progress)
- [ ] Create documentations (In progress)
- [ ] Enhance building and usage/integration (In progress)
- [ ] Create a CI/CD pipeline and github pages for the documentation and builds  (In progress, done on GitLab for the CI/CD)
- [ ] Migrate back from my selfhosted instance of GitLab to GitHub
- [ ] Add mobile support (In progress)
- [X] Add passthrough (Needs improvement but working)
- [ ] Port the rest of Dear ImGui and some extensions

It is currently on my selfhosted GitLab instance since it was easier to import it there with the issues and merge requests than doing it on GitHub thanks to the integrated GitLab importer

For GitHub to GitHub some [tools](https://github.com/IQAndreas/github-issues-import) exists but it's not as seamless
